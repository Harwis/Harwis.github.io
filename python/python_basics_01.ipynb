    "\n",
    "    - Simple, easy to learn, and readable\n",
    "    - Available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems\n",
    "    - Large standard library and active community\n",
    "    - Versatile; can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more\n",
    "    - Free to use\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics from GitHub and Google show that Python became the most popular programming language in 2020, and its popularity continues to increase."
