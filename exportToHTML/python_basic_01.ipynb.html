At this platform, I will try to be interactive and share let us share our knowledge each other.  I hope you can learn Python programming with the sense of useful, easy and fun.  
Before start Python programming, we need to set up a good working environment, that is we need to install Anaconda and Pycharm.  
 
AnacondaÂ® Distribution is a Python/R data science distribution and it is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support. You can follow the instruction of installation from the offical website: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html.
